# FamilyFriend

This are just some of the codes that I made in this project. I can't share all of them because this project was made for a company.

## Description
Development of a mobile application focused on older adults to increase and reaffirm their autonomy and
independence, reducing the need for admission to care services for the elderly.
 - I did the database design in MySQL, developing the back end with Python and Django.
 - I designed a section for the website and registration to the application with HTML and Bootstrap.
 - I made the connection between the website and database.
